/* The battery-save file: replacing one atomically, and reading one back after a
   power cut in the middle of a replace.

 * Plain stdio and unistd on purpose, with logging, chunking and yielding behind
 * macros, so gbsp/test/sram_file_test.c can compile and exercise exactly this
 * code on the host. The interesting cases -- a half-written file, a cut between
 * the remove and the rename, an empty file -- are the ones that are hard to
 * produce on the board and easy to produce in a test.
